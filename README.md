Three different enemy type created with different materials. Fire particle plays when hit enemy. <br/>
Tower shake when gets hit. <br/>
I used UniTask for coroutines to be more efficient.<br/>
I was thinking using shader for effect so opened project in URP but couldn't use it since I didn't want it to take longer then intended.
